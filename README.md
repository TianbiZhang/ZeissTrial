## Introduction

The ZeissTrial software series are a series of software monitoring and controlling a Zeiss scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was originally developed by Tianbi Zhang for his PhD work on a custom transmission Kikuchi diffraction setup, where the software facilitates automated beam scan and pattern capture.

This project was directly adapted from the demo project shipped along with the SmartSEM programming interface.

A more detailed description of this software can be found in readme.pdf.
